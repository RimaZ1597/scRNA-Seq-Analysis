# scRNA-Seq-Analysis

## Introduction to RNA seq
Used to measure gene expression.

### Three main steps for RNA seq
1. Prepare a sequence library
   - Isolate the RNA
     
   - Break RNA into small fragments
     
   - Convert RNA into dsDNA
     
   - Add adapters
     
   - PCR amplification
2. Sequence
   - Sequencer/sequencing machine
     
   - Quality control
     
3. Data analysis

### BULK
- Extract RNA
  
- Average gene expression across all the cells
  
- Impossible to compare differences in gene expression between individual cells
  

### SINGLE
- Extract RNA from all the cells
  
- Sequence RNA from each cell and quantify the expression

## Bulk v/s single-cell RNA sequencing

SINGLE CELL RNA SEQ ADVANTAGES

- Allows you to compare the expression between cells
  
- Identify rare cell population
  
- Understand spatial transcriptomics
  
- Track cell lineage
